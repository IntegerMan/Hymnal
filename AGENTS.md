# Hymnal — Agent Orientation

## What This App Does

Hymnal is a cross-platform desktop manuscript editor for authors using the **Book.txt / Markua** workflow.

- Opens a folder as a workspace and locates `Book.txt` at the root or under `manuscript/`
- Parses `Book.txt` lines into an ordered chapter list shown in a sidebar
- Opens chapter files in a single-buffer editor with save-before-switch and atomic file writes
- Watches open files for external changes
- Stores per-chapter notes under `.hymnal-data/notes/` in the workspace
- Persists last workspace and chapter between launches (settings in OS AppData)
- Treats files with `{class: part}` in first lines as non-selectable Part nodes in the sidebar

## Build & Run

```bash
# Build (from repo root)
dotnet build src/Hymnal/Hymnal.csproj

# Run desktop app
dotnet run --project src/Hymnal/Hymnal.csproj
```

## Test

```bash
# Must use solution file — bare 'dotnet test' fails with multiple projects
dotnet test Hymnal.sln
```

Baseline: 31 tests, 0 failures.

## Key Patterns

### ViewModels
- All ViewModels extend `ViewModelBase` which provides `Disposables` (`CompositeDisposable`) and `IActivatableViewModel` — use `subscription.DisposeWith(Disposables)` for cleanup
- Derived read-only properties use `ObservableAsPropertyHelper<T>` via `.ToProperty()` — never expose mutable props for computed state
- Commands are `ReactiveCommand.CreateFromTask()` or `ReactiveCommand.Create()` with a `canExecute` observable gate
- Debounced auto-save uses `Subject<string>` + `.Throttle(TimeSpan)` + `.Subscribe(async text => ...)` — see `NotesViewModel`
- `_isSwitching` bool guard in `WorkspaceViewModel` prevents re-entrant chapter switches — follow the same pattern for any async switch operation

### Services & Results
- Service methods return `Result<T>` (see `src/Hymnal.Core/Common/Result.cs`) — always propagate via `Result.Ok(value)` / `Result.Fail(message)`; never throw for expected failures
- `Unit` (see `src/Hymnal.Core/Common/Unit.cs`) is the return type for commands/observables with no meaningful value
- Atomic writes go through `IMetadataStore.WriteTextAtomicAsync()` (write temp → rename) — EditorViewModel and NotesViewModel both delegate to this

### Data Model
- `ManuscriptModel` holds chapters in a `SourceCache<ChapterNode, string>` (DynamicData) keyed by `RelativePath` — bind via `.Connect().AsObservableList()` or `.Bind()` to an `ObservableCollection`
- `ChapterNode` is an immutable `record` — `Key == RelativePath` (both are forward-slash normalized); `NodeKind.Part` nodes are non-selectable in the sidebar

### DI Registration
- Registration order in `App.axaml.cs` matters: `EditorViewModel` must be registered before `WorkspaceViewModel`; they are both `AddSingleton`
- `FolderPickerService` requires a `Func<TopLevel?>` accessor — see `App.axaml.cs` for the factory registration pattern

### Tests
- Test fixtures (sample manuscripts) live in `tests/Hymnal.Core.Tests/Fixtures/SampleManuscripts/` — load via `AppContext.BaseDirectory`
- Prefer hand-rolled fakes (e.g., `FakeNotificationService`) over NSubstitute for simple interfaces; use NSubstitute for complex interfaces with many members
- Infra tests that touch the file system use temp directories and clean up in `try/finally`

## Behavioral Guidelines

**Do:**
- Follow the MVVM pattern — logic belongs in ViewModels or Core services, not code-behind
- Use ReactiveUI (`WhenAnyValue`, `ReactiveCommand`, etc.) for bindings and commands
- Write or update unit tests in `Hymnal.Core.Tests` for any Core service change
- Use atomic writes for file operations (write to temp, then rename/replace)
- Access files only through the service/interface layer — no raw `File.*` calls in ViewModels
- Use `ICredentialStore` for any secret storage — never write credentials or API keys to disk

**Don't:**
- Put business logic directly in Views or code-behind files
- Modify chapter `.md` files outside of the editor save path
- Bypass `INotesService`, `IChapterRegistryService`, or `IMetadataStore` to write `.hymnal-data` directly
- Assume `dotnet test` alone works — always target the solution file

## Planned Features

These areas are designed but not yet fully implemented:

- **Markua syntax highlighting** — inline highlighting and validation in the editor
- **Project management** — chapter status lifecycle, live word count, per-chapter targets
- **Gantt phase view** — custom time-axis rendering with inline date editing
- **Corkboard view** — card layout with drag-to-reorder (Late V1)
- **Supplemental docs** — file/folder sidebar for non-chapter assets
- **Lightweight Git** — stage-all → commit → push via system Git binary
- **AI editorial** — provider config, chapter summaries, chat panel, issue flagging
- **Credential store** — currently an in-memory stub; will use OS credential manager (Windows Credential Manager / libsecret)
